refactor(chess-logic): Centralize move generation and simplify validation

This commit refactors the core chess logic to centralize move generation and simplify move validation.

Key changes:

-   **Centralized Move Generation:** A new `getPossibleMoves` function has been introduced in `src/lib/controls/pieces/possible-moves.ts` to serve as a single entry point for calculating all possible moves for a given piece. This replaces the `getPossibleMoves` method previously on the `Piece` object itself.

-   **Simplified Move Validation:** The `isValidMove` function has been simplified. It now takes the `Piece` object directly, rather than a `getPossibleMoves` function, which streamlines the validation process.

-   **File Renaming and Deletion:** Several files have been renamed for consistency (e.g., `useChessboard.ts` to `use-chess-board.ts`) or deleted as part of the refactoring (`chessBoard.ts`, `moves.ts`).

-   **Component Updates:** Components have been updated to use the new centralized move generation and validation logic.

This refactoring improves the structure and maintainability of the codebase by decoupling move generation from the piece definitions and providing a clearer, more centralized approach to handling game logic.
